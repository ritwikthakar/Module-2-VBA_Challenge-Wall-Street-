# Stock Analysis (VBA Challenge)
## Overview
The objective of this analysis is to help Steve Analyze stock performance for years 2017 & 2018 anmake investment recommendations for his parent’s portfolio. Steve is using historical stock returns and historical trading volumes from years 2017 & 2018 to make his recommendations. To make this function easier for Steve, we will be refactoring a VBA code which will automate the function for deriving historical trading volumes and historical stock returns for Steve to make recommendations.
## Results
Based on the Stock Analysis for year 2017 & 2018, stocks with ticker RUN will be recommended for Steve’s parent’s portfolio. For the year 2017, RUN’s return was not significant was at 5.5% compare to other stocks however the stock’s trading volume was over 267 million and was among the top 5 highly traded stocks. We can see that in the chart below.

For the year 2018, RUN delivered a return of 84% and was only one of the two stocks which yielded a positive return. Stock with ticker ENPH was the other positive stock in 2018 with 81% however the return had declined to 81% in 2018 from 129% in 2017. This indicates a downward trend in return for the stock. RUN went from 5.5% in 2017 to 84% in 2018 which signals an upward trend. Based on this information, RUN will be a more suitable pick in the portfolio to optimize returns.

## Advantages & Disadvantages of Refactoring Codes
One of the advantages of refactoring the code is that It can significantly boost system performance and it allows you to modify some elements of the system for it to cater to the ever-changing business needs. The disadvantage to this is that some codes could be written badly, and so many bugs could be raised. In this case, fixing of bugs take too much effort and time.

## Advantages & Disadvantages of Refactoring VBA Script
One of the advantages of refactoring the VBA script was there was a cleaner, extensible, easier to maintain code base which had functions in place which would help in code building. One of the disadvantages of refactoring was If there was a need to make some big changes with respect to the parameters used for analysing the data, it would be a lot easier to build new script from scratch instead of refactoring it.
